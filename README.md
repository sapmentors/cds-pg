# `cds-pg` - PostgreSQL adapter for SAP CDS (CAP)

First a big thank you to our contributors:

[![Contributors Display](https://badges.pufler.dev/contributors/sapmentors/cds-pg?size=50&padding=5&bots=false)](https://github.com/sapmentors/cds-pg/graphs/contributors)

~~This node module provides an adapter to the PostgreSQL database~~

For a short introduction on the background of this project you can check out [a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sPczwYN5Q&t=2310s) that has been captured as part of the SAP devtoberfest.

## Current status

Please use [@cap-js/postgres](https://github.com/cap-js/cds-dbs/tree/main/postgres)!

~~**_cds-pg_ is ready to be used!
Still, there's some gaps left to fill - note the list below and please see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute additional capabilities!~~

Also checkout the following blog posts on how to get started using `cds-pg` in your local development environment and on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), Cloud Foundry:

- [Setup an example project using `cds-pg`](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/16/getting-started-with-cap-on-postgresql-node.js/)
- [Prepare and deploy the project to SAP BTP CF](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/30/run-and-deploy-cap-with-postgresql-on-sap-cloud-platform-cloud-foundry-node.js/)


## Usage in your CAP project

Please use [@cap-js/postgres](https://github.com/cap-js/cds-dbs/tree/main/postgres)!

~~Add this package to your [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](ht~ps://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) project by running:~~

```bash
npm install cds-pg
```

~~Then add this configuration to the `cds` section of your `package.json:~~

```JSON
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "db": {
        "kind": "postgres"
      },
      "postgres": {
        "dialect": "plain", // <- for cds >= 5.1
        "impl": "cds-pg",
        "model": [
          "srv"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```

For local development you can provide the credentials in the file `default-env.json` in the root folder of your project:

```JSON
{
  "VCAP_SERVICES": {
    "postgres": [
      {
        "name": "postgres",
        "label": "postgres",
        "tags": ["plain", "database"],
        "credentials": {
          "host": "localhost",
          "port": "5432",
          "database": "dbname",
          "user": "postgres",
          "password": "postgres",
          "schema":"public"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### CDS deployment

~~`cds-pg` contains the database adapter to translate the incoming requests to PostgreSQL during runtime, but also includes a _quick and dirty_ command to deploy the current data model to the PostgreSQL database specified in `default-env.json`. Initial data will also be filled from the provided `.csv` files following the approach described in [Providing Initial Data](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/databases#providing-initial-data). Be aware that the existing tables and views are deleted and then re-created according the CDS model, so this should **not be used in production environments**~~

`npx cds-pg deploy srv --to db`

~~For a more sophisticated approach, please check out `cds-dbm` at https://github.com/mikezaschka/c~s-dbm, which offers an advanced deployment model including delta handling of data and models!
Please also read the following blogposts for a detailed description, on how `cds-dbm` can be used in combintation with `cds-pg`:~~
