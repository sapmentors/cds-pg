# contributing to `cds-pg`

The PostgreSQL adapter to `CAP` lives off of the effort of the community 🧍‍♀️🧍🧍‍♂️.  
Only _together_ can we get this to a state where `cds-pg` achieves production-level quality 💪, providing a persistence option outside `sqlite` and `hana`.

**The overall goal is to validate SQL-results in PostgreSQL by issuing OData-calls via `cds`**:  
because we know the data model, we can predict the result of the OData call, thus asserting the correct SQL statement and `cds.Service`-implementation via PostgreSQL.

The two most crucial files/code points are:

- API implementation of `cds.Service` in `index.js`
- `cqn` to PostgreSQL-`sql` "compiler" in `lib/cqn2pgsql.js`

There most likely the majority of your work will take place.

The path towards _what to implement_ is paved via the tests (in `__tests__/*`) that issue bespoken OData-calls and provide example `cqn`-queries to transform.

The idea is to grab any not-yet-implemented (`test.todo(..)`) or incomplete (`test.skip(...)`) test and/or add new ones, and implement functionality of `cds-pg` based on those tests.

## setting up the development environment

there's multiple parallel levels that we recommend to set up in order to develop further features for `cds-pg`.  
essentially, this boils down to 3 things:

- local PostgreSQL server with content + Web-UI
- runnable OData queries + a test environment with debug (breakpoint) capabilites
- comparison with a supported persistence driver, sepcifically `sqlite` in-memory

With the above in place, coding 👨‍💻 becomes a charm :)

### initial setup

install required node modules:

```bash
$> npm i
```

use `node` in version `lts/erbium`.  
there's a `.nvmrc` provided, so on OS's supporting this, it's a matter of

```bash
$> nvm use
```

`CDS_DEBUG` and `DEBUG` environment variables are respected. Setting them causes `cds-pg` to produce verbose logging output (which you want 😉).

`Visual Studio Code` is the recommend IDE (b/c we use it 😆).  
If you're on a different IDE - no sweat, but we might not be able to help with e.g. debugging capabilites.

### local PostgreSQL server with content

we're providing a docker image that gets filled with content upon boot.  
in order for this to work, you need [`docker-desktop`](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.  
then it's a matter of running `npm run test:pg:up-nobg` that does all the heavy lifting for you.

```bash
$> npm run test:pg:up-nobg
# ...
Creating network "cap-proj_default" with the default driver
Creating cap-proj_db_1      ... done
Creating cap-proj_adminer_1 ... done
Attaching to cap-proj_adminer_1, cap-proj_db_1
# ...
```

In addition to a standalone, pre-filled PostgreSQL server, this also gives you a web-based frontend for PostgreSQL at http://localhost:8080
![web ui for postgresql ](./images/postgres-webui.png)

Choose `PostgreSQL` as `System`,  
`Username`: `postgres`,  
`Password`: `postgres`.

Upon successful login, you'll see the `beershop` db, w00t 🍺
![postgresql beershop database](./images/postgres-beershop.png)

Finally, rename `__tests__/__assets__/cap-proj/default-env-template.json` to `__tests__/__assets__/cap-proj/default-env.json` for having the sample CAP project authenticate locally against the dockerized PostgreSQL.

### runnable queries and runtime debug capabilites

`jest` is the test-runner and -framework.  
All tests are located in `__tests__`, files important for the test run-time in `__test__/__assets__`.

If the standalone `PostgreSQL` server is running as explained above, you can use regular `jest` commands and flows:

- `npm run jest` runs all tests in `__tests__`

  ```bash
  $> npm run jest
    # ...
    PASS  __tests__/cqn2pgsql.js
    PASS  __tests__/odata.js

    Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
    Tests:       3 skipped, 7 todo, 4 passed, 14 total
    Snapshots:   0 total
    Time:        3.936 s
  ```

- run a single test
  - by editing one of the test files, issuing `test.only(/*...*/)`
  - calling `npm run jest` or from the command line: `$> node_modules/.bin/jest`
- turn on `jest`'s watch mode and morph into TDD-mode: `$> node_modules/.bin/jest --watch`

#### OData queries

`supertest` is used for bootstrapping http requests, e.g. in `__tests__/odata.js`.  
Since it's the goal to validate the query-results on PostgreSQL-level by issuing OData-calls via the `cds`-framework, the OData queries are the "test-base" for transformation of `cqn` to PostgreSQL's SQL dialect.

The more OData queries we have to test, the more complete `cds-pg` will be as a persistence layer.

#### Debugging

A debug configuration is provided for VS Code in `.vscode/launch.json`.  
Open a test file (from `__tests__`), and shoot of `run current test file` in VS Code's `debug` view in order to...well...debug the current test file.

As an alternative in VS Code, just open/create a `JavaScript Debug Terminal` and shoot of `npm run jest`.![javascript debug terminal](./images/console-debug.png)

Any set breakpoints in the code will then be hit during run-time of the tests.

### comparison possibility with `sqlite`

To be able to compare expected OData query results within an officially (by SAP) supported scenario,  
`npm run test:as-sqlite`  
bootstraps the base cap project in `__tests__/__assets__/cap-proj` with an in-mem SQListe database.

```bash
$> npm run test:as-sqlite
# ...
 > filling csw.Beers from db/data/csw-Beers.csv
 > filling csw.Brewery from db/data/csw-Brewery.csv
/> successfully deployed to sqlite in-memory db


[cds] - model loaded from 3 file(s):

  db/schema.cds

[cds] - connect to db > sqlite { database: ':memory:' }
 > filling csw.Beers from db/data/csw-Beers.csv

[cds] - launched in: 1210.114ms

```

As stated above, the SQLite-based app is accessible via http://localhost:4004

### run tests agains SCP cf PostgreSQL, hyperledger service

SAP offers a [managed PostgreSQL instance on CF](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/postgresql-hyperscaler-option) now. It is also possible to deploy the sample project included here in cds-pg (`__tests__/__assets__/cap-proj`) to SAP CP and connect it to the cf-based hyperscaler PostgreSQL service.

_Note:_ all of the below will work in local \*nix-like environments only (Linux, macOS, WSL on Windows), not on Windows `cmd` or `powershell`.

First, create an instance `cap-proj-database` of the hyperscaler PostgreSQL service

```js
# using the "trial" plan here
# and targeting PostgreSQL 11
$> cf create-service postgresql-db trial cap-proj-database -c "{\"engine_version\":\"11\" }"
# this takes some time -
# check status via
# $> cf service cap-proj-database
```

Then, on a shell, log into the target org and space via `cf login`.

In the same shell, build + deploy the sample CAP project:

```js
# always try to use the target node.js version
$> nvm use
Found '/Users/you/cds-pg/.nvmrc' with version <lts/erbium>
Now using node v12.19.0 (npm v6.14.9)

$> npm run deploy:cf
# ... builds an mta archive consisting of a single app "cap-proj-srv"
# ... and deploys to to your cf target org + space
# ... binding it to the "cap-proj-database"
# ... also deploys the sample data!
Staging application "cap-proj-srv"...
Application "cap-proj-srv" staged
Starting application "cap-proj-srv"...
Application "cap-proj-srv" started and available at "<yourspace>-cap-proj-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com"
```

Rename `/__tests__/__assets__/cap-proj/.env.example` into `__tests__/__assets__/cap-proj/.env` and put the above `<yourspace>-cap-proj-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com` into there:

```bash
# content of .env
scpServiceURL = https://<yourspace>-cap-proj-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
```

That's it!

Now the test environment of `cds-pg` picks up the environment variable and will run the relevant test-suites against your hyperscaler PostgreSQL service (via the deployed `cap-proj-srv` application), denoted by a `[scp]` prefix.

```js
$> yarn jest service.test.js --verbose
# ...
  [local] OData to Postgres dialect
    ✓ $metadata document (52 ms)
    ✓ List of entities exposed by the service (6 ms)
    odata: GET -> sql: SELECT
      ✓ odata: entityset Beers -> sql: select all beers (369 ms)
# ...
  [scp] OData to Postgres dialect
    ✓ $metadata document (202 ms)
    ✓ List of entities exposed by the service (135 ms)
    odata: GET -> sql: SELECT
      ✓ odata: entityset Beers -> sql: select all beers (2552 ms)
# ...
```
